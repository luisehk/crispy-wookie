# crispy wookie
This app is an effort to automatize my daily tasks such manage my budget, pay the rent, remind me to do stuff like exercise or send some email, keep an eye on my exercise routine and diet, show me only relevant stuff from social media, alert me when I receive an important email, wake me up in the morning, brew me some coffee, send me a photo when someone knocks my door and I'm not home, etc. You get the idea.

This project is built for my own personal use so it may not fit everyone's lifestyle, but the code is open so you can fork it or submit a pull request.

### Why?
I know there are a lot of apps out there for this, but I want everything in one single place instead of using 30 different apps. I will also use this project to learn Docker, React and Swift.

### Status
In development
